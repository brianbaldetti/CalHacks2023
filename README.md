# CalHacks2023
Project code from 2023 CalHacks AI focused Hackathon.

# CREDIT
This project was not only coded by myself. The idea, code, and design was developed alongside my group during the hackathon. I couldn't have done it on my own.

# ABOUT
This program intends to automate your creative process as it can be used to help seek perspective and insite into your ideas. Use four different prompting perspective--explorer, expert, refiner, critic––to help contextualize your idea.

This was my first time really coding in python and I have to say that I struggled a lot. Also, this was also basically my first time using an API as well to make calls and such so a lot of this project was foreign to me as well.
